# ARJewelBox - Virtual Jewelry Trial System
ARJewelBox is a software application that allows users to try on jewelry virtually using augmented reality (AR) 
technology. By using a camera and a screen, the user can see themselves wearing different jewelry pieces in real-time, 
without the need to physically handle the actual jewelry. This technology can be used by jewelry retailers and 
e-commerce websites to enhance the online shopping experience and increase sales.
